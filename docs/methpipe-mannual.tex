\title{Methpipe Manual}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
The methpipe software package is a comprehensive tool chain for
analyzing whole genome bisulfite sequencing data (BS-Seq).  This
documentation will guide you step by step to learn how to perform the
data analysis in a BS-Seq project with methpipe. To facilitate
understanding of the work flow, we divide the analysis procedure into
four steps: (1) Pre-mapping processing: this step include assessing
read quality and pre-processing reads, such as trimming adapters; (2)
Mapping: this step maps sequence reads to a reference genome; (3)
Analyzing methylation status at single site: in this step, we will
estimate methylation frequency at single site, either CpG sites or
non-CpG sites. We will also obtain information about sequencing depth
and bisulfite conversion rate; (4) Higher level analysis: this step
includes higher level more biologically interesting analysis, such as
identifying hypo-methylated regions and/or differentially methylated
regions. Later we will describe in detail the usage of tools in each
step.

In the guide we will use a small project as example. Suppose that in
this project you would like to study the methylation pattern in two
cell types, B cells and neutrophiles. The B cell methylome is profiled
with sing-end sequencing and your university's sequencing center sends
back to you these sequence files:
\begin{verbatim}
bcell/s-1.fq bcell/s-2.fq bcell/s-3.fq bcell/s-4.fq.
\end{verbatim}
The neutrophile methylome is profiled with pair-end sequencing and you
have the following sequences files:
\begin{verbatim}
neut/s-1-1.fq neut/s-1-2.fq neut/s-2-1.fq neut/s-2-2.fq.
\end{verbatim}
Now we are ready to uncover the interesting biology about DNA
methylation from this dataset. 

\section{Pre-mapping processing}
\label{sec:premapping}
% \begin{description}
% \item[read-quality-prof.cpp]
% This program take a fastq file as input and output the base composition and 
% quality scores for each column
% \item[quality-prof.R]
% This R script define a function that takes the output of read-quality-prof.cpp as input 
% and draw the figure of base composition
% \item[trim-adapter.cpp] 
% This program expects a fastq file as input and trim the adapter sequence from the 3' end
% of reads if there is.
% \item[visireads.cpp]
% This program takes a fastq file as input and output a BED file displaying Cs in 
% the sequences
% \end{description}

Before mapping sequenced reads to a reference genome, we need to
pre-process the raw read sequences, in particular we need to trim
possible adapter sequences retained in the 3' end of raw
reads. Further we may be interested in examining the quality of reads
in our library and visualizing raw reads in UCSC Genome Browser. 

\subsection{Trim adapters}
\label{sec:trim-adapter}
As the length of reads that sequencing technology is able to produce
has been increasing all the time, it is possible there are adapter
sequences in the 3' end of some reads. These retained adapter
sequences affects the mappability of such reads. Even if they are
somehow mapped to the reference genome, the adapter sequences may
introduce bias to our estimate of methylation frequency. Therefore it
is necessary to trim these retained adapter sequences. 

The program \textbf{trim-adapter} is used to trim adapter sequences,
if any, from the 3' end of raw reads. Suppose the adapter sequences is
\textit{GATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAGACCGATCTCGTATGCCG}, we trim
the adapter sequences from raw reads in the file bcell/s-1.fq with the
following command:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./trim-adapter  s-1.fq -o s-1-clipped.fq  
-a GATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAGACCGATCTCGTATGCCG  
\end{verbatim}

If you would like to check the effective read length after trimming
adapter sequences and Ns from 3' end, you can add \textbf{-l} options
to specify the output file for effective read length, for example,
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./trim-adapter  s-1.fq -o s-1-clipped.fq  -l s-1-length.txt
-a GATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAGACCGATCTCGTATGCCG  
\end{verbatim}
The file s-1-length.txt lists the effective read length of each read
after trimming adapter sequences and Ns, which can be used to compute
the statistics of effective reads lengths with any general purpose
statistical package, such as R. Perform this trimming adapter
processing on all sequences files and for convenience we assume the
processed sequences files have their original file names thereafter.

\subsection{Assessing read quality}
\label{sec:read-qual-assessm}
It is optional to assess read quality before mapping, however such
assessment may help us to spot potential problems during library
preparation and/or bisulfite sequencing. The program
\textbf{read-quality-prof} is used to generate an average summary of
base composition and quality scores from 5' to 3' along all
reads.  We run \textbf{read-quality-prof} as following 
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./read-quality-prof  < s-1.fq > s-1-qual.txt
\end{verbatim}
The output file s-1-qual.txt can be visualized with the R software. 
Fig. \ref{fig:base-composition} shows the base composition profile in
the pair-end sequencing sample, where the left panel shows  T-rich
reads and the right panel A-rich reads. Note the small proportion of C
and G reflects the effect of bisulfite conversion.

\section{Mapping}
\label{sec:mapping}

% \begin{description}
% \item[rmapbs.cpp]
% This program takes fastq file as input and output mapped read file
% \end{description}

In the mapping step, you will map sequence reads to a reference
genome. During bisulfite treatment, unmethylated cytosines in the
original DNA sequences are converted to uracils, which are in turn
incorporated as thymines during PCR amplification. We call such strand
T-rich and its complementary strand A-rich (adenine-rich).  When
mapping T-rich reads to the reference genome, either a cytosine (C) or
a thymine (T) in reads is considered valid match to a cytosine in the
reference genome. But for A-rich reads, a adenine or a guanine is
consider valid match to a guanine in the reference genome.    

If using single-end sequencing, you will get T-rich reads only. If
using pair-end sequencing, you will get both T-rich reads and A-rich
reads. Next we will learn how to map bisulfite treated reads with
\textbf{rmapbs} from either single-end sequencing or pair-end
sequencing. 

\subsection{Mapping single-end sequencing reads}
\label{sec:mapping-single-end}
Mapping read sequences to the reference genome is done by
\textbf{rmapbs}. Before mapping, you need to get he genome sequences
of appropriate organism and assembly, which is usually downloadable
from \href{http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html}{UCSC Genome
  Browser download portal} or other specific repositories of genome
sequences, such as \href{http://www.arabidopsis.org/}{TAIR} for
Arabidopsis \textit{thaliana}. Suppose that you have already
downloaded the appropriate genome sequences, in our example human
genome hg18, in the directory \textit{human-genome}, to map the reads
in bcell/s-1.fq to the reference genome we run
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./rmapbs -c human-genome -s fa -m 4 -o bcell/s-1.bed bcell/s-1.fq -v. 
\end{verbatim}
Here we briefly explain some commonly used options of
\textbf{rmapbs}. The option \textbf{-c} specifies the direcotory
holding the reference genome and the \textbf{-s} specifies the suffix
of sequence file names. The option \textbf{-m} gives the maximum
number of mismatches allowed. The option \textbf{-o} specifies the
output file. 

\subsection{Mapping pair-end sequencing reads}
\label{sec:mapping-pair-end}



\subsection{Parallel mapping}
\label{sec:parallel-mapping}
Mapping is the most time-consuming and resource-demanding step in the
methpipe pipeline. Fortunately we may adopt a ``divide and conquer''
strategy to speed up this step.  In brief, we first divide large
sequence files into smaller ones, map them separately in parallel and
finally combining the mapped files.

A large sequence file is divided into smaller ones with the
\textbf{split} utility which is a standard utility in any UNIX-like
platforms. By running
\begin{verbatim}
$ split -l 16000000 bcell/s-1.fq s-1
\end{verbatim}
you will get a series of smaller files: s-1aa, s-1ab, s-1ac, etc,
which can be mapped with \textbf{rmapbs} separately as described
above. To learn about the detailed usage of \textbf{split}, you may
read its man page. In brief, the \textbf{-l} option specifies the
number of lines in each smaller file. Since FASTQ format requires that
each read consist of four lines, i.e. name line, sequence line, name
line and score line, the number of lines should be multipliers of
4. The optimal number depends on the time constraints and memory
contraints of your computing platform. For your information, mapping
$28$ millions reads to the Arabidopsis \textit{thaliana} genome with
\textbf{rmapbs} uses about 40 minutes and 5Gb memory.

\section{A sample work flow}
This part shows how these tools are connected to get the methylation
profile. Suppose we have the following BS-Seq library

\end{verbatim}

The final result can be obtained as following. For clarity, we show
all the intermediate result. In real application, some intermediate
files can be avoided by using pipes.
